                    <h4>The Gallery of Rome</h4>
                    <p>All the lights went out in the room. Amelia whipped around, ready to meet the owner of the creepy voice, but found no one behind her. Before she had a chance to call for help, the lights flickered back on. </p>
                    <p>“That is weird…” she whispered to herself. The once bustling exhibit was completely empty, except for herself- </p>
                    <p>“What is?” Someone asked from behind her. Who could have said that? There was no one around.</p>
                    <p>“Hello?” She called back, “Who said that?!”</p>
                    <p>“HEY!” Amelia nearly jumped 5 feet in the air. The voice was coming from right next to her, from the bust of the young boy. “Be careful,” he chastised her, “you shouldn’t go screaming into peoples ears.” </p>
                    <p>“But-” this had to be a dream! Or her imagination! “-you’re missing your ears.” The young boy craned his neck, as if he could look at his own ear.</p>
                    <p>“Oh man! How did that happen?” The statue frowned. While he thought over his missing ear, Amelia took a second to look around. To her amazement, she found that it was not just the one statue that had miraculously come to life.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no!” She gasped as the statue of a woman began to look around wildly, searching desperately for her missing head. Everywhere, all around her, the marble people began to realize that they were all missing some body part or another. “Hey, you! Can you give me a hand?” Asked a pint-sized roman soldier. All at once, they  began to ask for her help. </p>
                    <p>“How are you even speaking English!? Aren’t you from Rome?” She asked in exasperation.</p>
                    <p>“Huh. The little soldier stopped for a moment to think on it. “Well, we have been sitting in this museum for years. We were bound to pick up a couple languages.” And without another word, his back stiffened and he toppled to his side and fell over.</p>
                    <p>“You had one question to ask and that was the one you chose?” The voice said, ominously, from somewhere behind her. All around her, the statues return to their natural state, but none of them in their place. Uh oh!</p>
