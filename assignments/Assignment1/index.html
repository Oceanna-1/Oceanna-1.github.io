                    <h4>A Day at the Museum</h4>
                    <p>Amelia had always loved the museum. She liked looking at artifacts and imaging the life of the person who used it last. What could be more fun than looking at glimpses into the past? So of course she was ecstatic when she found out her class would be going on a field trip to her favourite museum, the ROM.</p>
                    <p>The building was nestled into the centre of the busy city of Toronto, a piece of history carved into the New Age. After all the students in her class had spilled out of the bus, they filed into the entryway and partnered off. Amelia and her best friend tried to decide what exhibits to visit first. Her best friend, Maureen, wanted to go to the wildlife exhibit.</p>
                    <p>“No way!” Amelia declared, “I see that stuff every day. We are going to the Roman gallery!” </p>
                    <p>“I do NOT care about dusty, old statues!” Her best friend protested. Unable to come to a decision, the two decided to split up,  and Amelia headed to the Roman gallery on her own. </p>
                    <p>The hall was brightly lit, and many marble busts sat on pedestals. Their hollow eyes seemed to follow her as she approached to get a better look. She stood nearly eye to eye with one of the biggest heads, nearly twice the size of her own. </p>
                    <p>“An emperor, huh? No wonder why your head is so big.” She walked farther down the row, and stopped in front of the bust of a young boy, probably only a few years younger than herself. </p>
                    <p>“What was you life like, I wonder. I wish I could ask you.” With a sudden hiss and pop, a gravelly voice appeared behind her.</p>
                    <p>“Be careful what you wish for!”</p>
